        Hi, Iâ€™m Paulina ðŸ‘‹
      </h1>
      <p className={'text-preset-7 '}>
        Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building
        little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I
        learn along the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading,
        hiking through the mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing
        walls.
        <br />
        <br />I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself
        accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code.
        Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
      </p>
